This document corresponds to the latest version of PushIOManager for Android.\r\n\r\n## Definitions\r\n\r\n#### App ID\r\nEach individual application has a unique ID used by the application to communicate with the Push IO service.\r\n\r\n#### Sender Secret \r\nThis is a secret shared between Push IO and the developer using direct device messaging which authorizes them to send to an account.\r\n\r\n#### Category\r\nA category defines a specific content type that your app has which users might \tbe interested in. For example, if your app is a sports app, a category may be a specific team. \r\n\r\n#### Audience   \r\nAn audience defines a group of users based on one or more categories or platforms. For example, you might make an audience out of all of the users who have registered to a category for a team in the Western Conference who are using your app on Android.\r\n\r\n#### Test Device  \r\nA device specially registered with Push IO to help you troubleshoot, test, and preview push notifications.\r\n\r\n## API Integration\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\nPush IO provides a simple RESTful API with JSON responses.\r\n\r\nThe API offers methods for sending broadcast, targeted (category-based), and test device push notifications. Sending through the API allows you to target users on all of your platforms with a single call.\r\n\r\nPush IO is the only push notification provider which provides data that allows you to understand how push notification engagement leads your users to high-value actions like in-app purchases, premium content viewing, and more. The PushIOManager library provides a simple mechanism to capture this push conversion information, which is available to you via the [Push IO Manager](https://manage.push.io) dashboard.\r\n\r\n### API Prerequisites\r\nBefore continuing, be sure you have what you need to integrate Push IO into your app.\r\n\r\n1. Sign up for an account at [https://manage.push.io](https://manage.push.io)\r\n2. Complete PushIOManager integration for your app (see [Push IO Integration Guides](http://docs.push.io)\r\n\r\nAll set?
